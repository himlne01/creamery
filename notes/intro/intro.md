Using `telnet` to retrieve web resources interactively

```bash
telnet luther.edu 80
Trying 174.129.25.170...
Connected to luther.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /index.html
<html>
<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.12.2</center>
</body>
</html>
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

Specify HTTP version (1.1) and host for a detailed response.

```bash
telnet luther.edu 80
Trying 174.129.25.170...
Connected to luther.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: luther.edu

Use `openssl` to connect securely
